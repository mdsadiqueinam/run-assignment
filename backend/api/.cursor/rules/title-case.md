# Title Case Rule

## Titles should always be sentence-case, not title-case

When creating titles, headings, or labels in the application, always use sentence-case (only the first word and proper nouns capitalized) rather than title-case (where most words are capitalized).

### Examples:

✓ Correct (Sentence-case):

- "Configure the integration between Teamwork.com and wiseboxs.com"
- "Select destination project"
- "Choose which project to-dos are synced to"
- "Custom team destinations"

✗ Incorrect (Title-case):

- "Configure The Integration Between Teamwork.com And wiseboxs.com"
- "Select Destination Project"
- "Choose Which Project To-Dos Are Synced To"
- "Custom Team Destinations"

### Implementation:

- This applies to all UI elements including page titles, headings, button text, and labels
- Proper nouns (like "Teamwork.com" or "wiseboxs.com") should still be capitalized according to their brand guidelines
- Acronyms (like "UI" or "API") should maintain their standard capitalization
